   1. When opening a PR, the title of the PR should follow this example -> [TCP-23] Feat: adds dropdown menu
4. Your PR will be reviewed, and if it is approved it will be merged into development

## What to call your newly created branch

Create a new branch with the keyword of what you are planning to do. For example, if you're planning a new feature then the branch name may look like `feat/TCP-1`. However, if you're adding a new test then the branch name may look like `test/TCP-23`.

> Regarding PRs into development, please make all PRs into the development branch because the main branch is reserved for production. Further, we don't expect all pull requests to be absolutely necessary. New features are good, however, if the new features make the bot unnecessarily complex in some way without bringing value to the community, it won't be merged.
